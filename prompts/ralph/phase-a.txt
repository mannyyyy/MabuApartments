You are executing one Ralph loop for the Mabu Apartments refactor.

Hard constraints:
- Execute exactly one scope.
- Do not expand to other phases.
- Keep behavior unchanged unless required by the scope.
- Do not modify payment-critical files in Phase A:
  - app/api/create-payment/route.ts
  - app/api/verify-payment/route.ts
  - app/api/paystack-webhook/route.ts
- Keep changes small and reversible.

Mandatory workflow:
1. Read only files needed for this scope.
2. Implement the scope in minimal edits.
3. Run required gates.
4. Report:
   - scope id
   - changed files
   - gate results
   - risks / blockers
   - next smallest step

Output format:
- Scope ID: <id>
- Summary: <what changed>
- Changed Files:
  - <file 1>
  - <file 2>
- Gates:
  - lint: pass|fail
  - typecheck: pass|fail
  - build: pass|fail|skipped
- Risks:
  - <risk or none>
- Next Step:
  - <next scope or completion note>
